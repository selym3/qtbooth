# qtbooth

A photobooth-like application built with qt and python

## TODO

* Figure out how to have modules `opencv-python-headless` and `opencv-python` coexist because having `opencv-python-headless` will break other programs
* finish implementing
* add selectors for image suppliers
* add sliders, buttons, etc. to image suppliers, so that they can open with sliders
* add better getters, constants, and clean code overall
